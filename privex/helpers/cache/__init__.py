"""
Helper functions/classes related to caching.

This module acts as a singleton wrapper, allowing for easily setting a framework-independent global cache API.

To make the module easy to use, :py:func:`.adapter_get` initialises an instance of :class:`.MemoryCache` if no
global cache adapter instance has been setup. This means you can use the various alias functions in this module
without having to configure a cache adapter.

**Setting / updating the global cache adapter instance**::

First import the ``cache`` module.

    >>> from privex.helpers import cache

You must instantiate your cache adapter of choice before passing it to :py:func:`.adapter_set` - which updates
the global cache adapter instance.

    >>> my_adapter = cache.MemoryCache()
    >>> cache.adapter_set(my_adapter)

Once you've set the adapter, you can use the module functions such as :py:func:`.get` and :py:func:`.set` - or you
can import ``cached`` to enable dictionary-like cache item access.

    >>> cache.set('hello', 'world')
    >>> cache.get('hello')
    'world'
    >>> from privex.helpers import cached
    >>> cached['hello']
    'world'
    >>> cached['otherkey'] = 'testing'


**Plug-n-play usage**::

As explained near the start of this module's documentation, you don't have to set the global adapter if you only
plan on using the simple :class:`.MemoryCache` adapter.

Just start using the global cache API via either :py:mod:`privex.helpers.cache` or :py:mod:`privex.helpers.cache.cached`
and MemoryCache will automatically be instantiated as the global adapter as soon as something attempts to access
the global instance.

We recommend importing ``cached`` rather than ``cache``, as it acts as a wrapper that allows dictionary-like
cache key getting/setting, and is also immediately aware when the global cache adapter is set/replaced.

    >>> from privex.helpers import cached

You can access ``cached`` like a dictionary to get and set cache keys (they will use the default expiry time of
:py:attr:`privex.helpers.settings.DEFAULT_CACHE_TIMEOUT`)

    >>> cached['testing'] = 123
    >>> cached['testing']
    123


You can also call methods such as :py:func:`.get` and :py:func:`.set` for getting/setting cache items with more
control, for example:

1. Setting a custom expiration, or disabling expiration by setting timeout to ``None``
  
    >>> cached.set('example', 'test', timeout=30)   # Drop 'example' from the cache after 30 seconds from now.
    >>> cached.set('this key', 'is forever!', timeout=None) # A timeout of ``None`` disables automatic expiration.

2. Fallback values when a key isn't found, or have it throw an exception if it's not found instead.

    >>> cached.get('example', 'NOT FOUND')          # If the key 'example' doesn't exist, return 'NOT FOUND'
    'test'
    
    >>> try:   # By setting ``fail`` to True, ``get`` raises ``CacheNotFound`` if the key doesn't exist / is expired
    ...     cached.get('nonexistent', fail=True)
    ... except CacheNotFound:
    ...     log.error('The cache key "nonexistent" does not exist!')
    >>>

3. Using :py:func:`.get_or_set` you can specify either a standard type (e.g. ``str``, ``int``, ``dict``), or even
   a custom function to call to obtain the value to set and return.
 
    >>> cached.get_or_set('hello', lambda key: 'world', timeout=60)
    >>> cached['hello']
    'world'
