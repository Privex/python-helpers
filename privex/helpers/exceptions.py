    Thrown when the v4/v6 address boundary for a reverse DNS record is invalid.
    
    An "address boundary" is the minimum amount of bits that defines a character in a reverse DNS domain 
    (i.e. those ending in in-addr/ip6.arpa):

         - IPv6 uses "nibbles" of 4 bits for each individual character in a standard 128-bit address
         - IPv4 uses "octets" of 8 bits, which represent 0-255 in each of the 4 "blocks" within an IPv4 address
    
    This means the minimum and maximum boundaries for IPv4 and IPv6 are as such:

        IPv6 - Minimum boundary: 4 bits (``*.f.ip6.arpa``), Maximum boundary: 128 bits (rDNS for a single address, i.e. a /128)
        IPv4 - Minimum boundary: 8 bits (``x.x.x.127.in-addr.arpa``), Maximum boundary: 32 bits (``1.0.0.127.in-addr.arpa``)
