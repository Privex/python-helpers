    """
    Async Synchronous Decorator, borrowed from https://stackoverflow.com/a/23036785/2648583 - added this PyDoc comment
    and support for returning data from a synchronous function

    Allows a non-async function to run async functions using ``yield from`` - and can also return data

    Useful for unit testing, since unittest.TestCase functions are synchronous.

    Example async function:

        >>> async def my_async_func(a, b, x=None, y=None):
        ...     return a, b, x, y
        ...

    Using the above async function with a non-async function:

        >>> @async_sync
        ... def sync_function():
        ...     result = yield from my_async_func(1, 2, x=3, y=4)
        ...     return result
        ...
        >>> r = sync_function()
        >>> print(r)
        (1, 2, 3, 4,)
        >>> print(r[1])
