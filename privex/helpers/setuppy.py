Helpers for setup.py, e.g. requirements.txt parsing

**Example usage**
    
    >>> extensions = ['cache', 'crypto', 'django']
    # Loads ``extras/{extension}.txt`` for each extension, then returns a dictionary mapping each extension
    # to their requirements
    >>> extras_require(extensions)
    {'cache': ['redis'], 'crypto': ['cryptography>=2.8'], 'django': ['Django']}
    
    # Load ``example.txt`` and merge sub-requirement lists.
    >>> reqs('example.txt')
    ['privex-loghelper>=1.0', 'privex-jsonrpc', 'requests']
