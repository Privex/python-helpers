"""
This module handles connection objects for databases, APIs etc. by exposing functions which initialise and
store class instances for re-use.

It's primarily intended to be used to enable database, caching and third-party API connectivity for the helpers in this
package, however, you're free to use the functions / classes / attributes exposed in this module for your own apps.

Classes are generally initialised using the settings from :py:mod:`.settings` - see the docs for that module to learn
how to override the settings if the defaults don't work for you.
