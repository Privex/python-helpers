# Privex's Python Helpers

This small Python 3 module is comprised of various small functions and classes that were often
copied and pasted across our projects.

Each of these "helper" functions, decorators or classes are otherwise too small to be independantly
packaged, and so we've amalgamated them into this PyPi package, `privex-helpers`.

# Install

### Download and install from PyPi using pip (recommended)

```sh
pip3 install privex-helpers
```

### (Alternative) Manual install from Git

**Option 1 - Use pip to install straight from Github**

```sh
pip3 install git+https://github.com/Privex/python-helpers
```

**Option 2 - Clone and install manually**

```bash
# Clone the repository from Github
git clone https://github.com/Privex/python-helpers
cd python-helpers

# RECOMMENDED MANUAL INSTALL METHOD
# Use pip to install the source code
pip3 install .

# ALTERNATIVE MANUAL INSTALL METHOD
# If you don't have pip, or have issues with installing using it, then you can use setuptools instead.
python3 setup.py install
```

# Example uses

We export all of the submodule's contents in `privex/helpers/__init__.py`, so you can import any 
function/class/attribute straight from `privex.helper` without needing several import lines.

Here are some of the most useful examples (part of our `.common` module, no dependencies)

```python
from privex.helpers import empty, is_true, random_str, ip_is_v4, ip_is_v6

####
# Our empty() helper is very convenient and easy to remember. It allows you to quick check if a variable is "empty" 
# (a blank string, None, zero, or an empty list/dict/tuple).
#
#   empty(v, zero: bool = False, itr: bool = False) -> bool
#
# For safety, it only returns True for empty iterables / integer zero (0) if you enable `zero` and/or `itr` respectively.
####

x = ''
if empty(x):
    print('Var x is empty: either None or empty string')

y = []
if empty(y, itr=True):
    print('Var y is empty: either None, empty string, or empty iterable')

####
# Our is_true() / is_false() helpers are designed to ease checking boolean values from plain text config files
# such as .env files, or values passed in an API call
####

# The strings 'true' / 'y' / 'yes' / '1' are all considered truthy, plus int 1 / bool True
enable_x = 'YES'    # String values are automatically cast to lowercase, so even 'YeS' and 'TrUe' are fine.
if is_true(enable_x):
    print('Enabling feature X')

####
# Need to generate a random alphanumeric string for a password / API key? Try random_str(), which uses SystemRandom()
# for cryptographically secure randomness, and by default uses our SAFE_CHARS character set, removing look-alike 
# characters such as 1 and l, or o and 0
####

# Default random string - 50 character alphanum without easily mistaken chars
random_str()   # outputs: 'MrCWLYMYtT9A7bHc5ZNE4hn7PxHPmsWaT9GpfCkmZASK7ApN8r'

# Customised random string - 12 characters using only the characters `abcdef12345` 
random_str(12, chars='abcdef12345') # outputs: 'aba4cc14a43d'

####
# As a server hosting provider, we deal with IP addresses a lot :)
# The helper functions ip_is_v4 and ip_is_v6 do exactly as their name says, they return a boolean
# if an IP is IPv4 or IPv6 respectively.
####

ip_is_v4('192.168.1.1') # True
ip_is_v4('2a07:e00::1') # False

ip_is_v6('192.168.1.1') # False
ip_is_v6('2a07:e00::1') # True

```

# Minimal dependencies

Most of our helper code is independant, and does not result in any extra dependencies being installed. 

Some of our helpers are dependant on external libraries or frameworks, such as Django or Flask. To avoid
large Python packages such as Django being installed needlessly, we programatically enable/disable some
of the helpers based on whether you have the required dependency installed.

This package only requires (and automatically installs if needed) a single dependency - our 
[privex-loghelper](https://github.com/Privex/python-loghelper) package, which itself is lightweight
and dependency free.


Optional requirements (just `pip3 install` them depending on the helpers you require):

```
# For all Django-specific helpers in privex.helpers.django
Django
# For certain DNS dependant helpers in privex.helpers.net
dnspython>=1.16.0
```

# Contributing

We're happy to accept pull requests, no matter how small.

Please make sure any changes you make meet these basic requirements:

 - No additional dependencies. We want our helper package to be lightweight and painless to install.
 - Any code taken from other projects should be compatible with the MIT License
 - This is a new project, and as such, supporting Python versions prior to 3.4 is very low priority.
 - However, we're happy to accept PRs to improve compatibility with older versions of Python, as long as it doesn't:
   - drastically increase the complexity of the code
   - OR cause problems for those on newer versions of Python.

**Legal Disclaimer for Contributions**

Nobody wants to read a long document filled with legal text, so we've summed up the important parts here.

If you contribute content that you've created/own to projects that are created/owned by Privex, such as code or 
documentation, then you might automatically grant us unrestricted usage of your content, regardless of the open source 
license that applies to our project.

If you don't want to grant us unlimited usage of your content, you should make sure to place your content
in a separate file, making sure that the license of your content is clearly displayed at the start of the file 
(e.g. code comments), or inside of it's containing folder (e.g. a file named LICENSE). 

You should let us know in your pull request or issue that you've included files which are licensed
separately, so that we can make sure there's no license conflicts that might stop us being able
to accept your contribution.

If you'd rather read the whole legal text, it should be included as `privex_contribution_agreement.txt`.
