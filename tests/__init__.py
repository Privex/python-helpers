"""
This module contains test cases for Privex's Python Helper's (privex-helpers).


Testing pre-requisites
----------------------

    - Ensure you have any mandatory requirements installed (see setup.py's install_requires)
    - You should install ``pytest`` to run the tests, it works much better than standard python unittest.
    - You may wish to install any optional requirements listed in README.md for best results
    - Python 3.7 is recommended at the time of writing this. See README.md in-case this has changed.

For the best testing experience, it's recommended to install the ``dev`` extra, which includes every optional
dependency, as well as development requirements such as ``pytest`` , ``coverage`` as well as requirements for
building the documentation.


Running via PyTest
------------------

To run the tests, we strongly recommend using the ``pytest`` tool (used by default for our Travis CI)::

    # Install PyTest if you don't already have it.
    user@host: ~/privex-helpers $ pip3 install pytest
    
    # We recommend adding the option ``-rxXs`` which will show information about why certain tests were skipped
    # as well as info on xpass / xfail tests
    # You can add `-v` for more detailed output, just like when running the tests directly.
    user@host: ~/privex-helpers $ pytest -rxXs
    
    # NOTE: If you're using a virtualenv, sometimes you may encounter strange conflicts between a global install
    # of PyTest, and the virtualenv PyTest, resulting in errors related to packages not being installed.
    # A simple workaround is just to call pytest as a module from the python3 executable:
    
    user@host: ~/privex-helpers $ python3 -m pytest -rxXs

Running individual test modules
-------------------------------

Some test modules such as ``test_cache`` can be quite slow, as sometimes it's required to call sleep, e.g. ``sleep(2)``
either to prevent interference from previous/following tests, or when testing that an expiration/timeout works.

Thankfully, PyTest allows you to run individual test modules like this::
    
    user@host: ~/privex-helpers $ pytest -rxXs -v tests/test_parse.py

Running directly using Python Unittest
--------------------------------------

Alternatively, you can run the tests by hand with ``python3.7`` ( or just ``python3`` ), however we strongly
recommend using PyTest as our tests use various PyTest functionality to allow for things such as skipping tests
when you don't have a certain dependency installed.

Running via python unittest ::

    user@the-matrix ~/privex-helpers $ python3.7 -m tests
    ............................
    ----------------------------------------------------------------------
    Ran 28 tests in 0.001s

    OK

For more verbosity, simply add ``-v`` to the end of the command::

    user@the-matrix ~/privex-helpers $ python3 -m tests -v
    test_empty_combined (__main__.TestBoolHelpers) ... ok
    test_isfalse_truthy (__main__.TestBoolHelpers) ... ok
    test_v4_arpa_boundary_16bit (__main__.TestIPReverseDNS)
    Test generating 16-bit v4 boundary ... ok
    test_v4_arpa_boundary_24bit (__main__.TestIPReverseDNS)
    Test generating 24-bit v4 boundary ... ok
    test_kval_single (__main__.TestParseHelpers)
    Test that a single value still returns a list ... ok
    test_kval_spaced (__main__.TestParseHelpers)
    Test key:val csv parsing with excess outer whitespace, and value whitespace ... ok
    # Truncated excess output in this PyDoc example, as there are many more lines showing
    # the results of each individual testcase, wasting space and adding bloat...
    ----------------------------------------------------------------------
    Ran 28 tests in 0.001s

    OK
